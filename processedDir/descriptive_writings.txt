Descriptive writing creates an impression in the reader’s mind of an event, a place, a person, or thing. The writing will be such that it will set a mood or describe something in such detail that if the reader saw it, they would recognize it. Descriptive writing will bring words to life and makes the text interesting. 

Some examples of descriptive text include:

The sunset filled the entire sky with the deep color of rubies, setting the clouds ablaze.  
The waves crashed and danced along the shore, moving up and down in a graceful and gentle rhythm like they were dancing. 
The painting was a field of flowers, with deep and rich blues and yellows atop vibrant green stems that seemed to beckon you to reach right in and pick them. 
The old man was stooped and bent, his back making the shape of a C and his head bent so far forward that his beard would nearly have touched his knobby knees had he been just a bit taller. 
His deep and soulful blue eyes were like the color of the ocean on the clearest day you can ever imagine. 
The soft fur of the dog felt like silk against my skin and her black coloring glistened as it absorbed the sunlight, reflecting it back as a perfect, deep, dark mirror.
